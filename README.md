## Need An Umbrella frontend

### Summary

This project is a weather app. Here you can search for different cities to check the weather and you can add or remove them from your favorite list.
In this project I use authentication and authorization technology with JWT tokens and refresh token logic. Here I have two tokens: access token which has a life span of 1 week and refresh token which has a lifespan of 15 minutes. The tokens are stored in cookies and are protected by javascript scripts.
<br/>
You can create your account by registering or by using your google account for which I use google oAuth 2.0.

Some other features are the dark mode/light mode and also you can edit your profile and change your profile picture.

Please feel free to go through the code and for anything you want to ask or suggest me you can find my contacts in my profile page in Github! Thank you!
